# Land Use Calculator

A tool for comparing the carbon impact of different land use choices, specifically reforestation versus solar panel installation.

## Features

- Interactive map for selecting land areas
- Calculation of potential carbon sequestration from reforestation
- Calculation of potential energy generation and carbon offset from solar panels
- Visual comparison of results

## Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- Python (v3.8+)
- Mapbox API key (for the map functionality)

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:# Land Use Calculator
